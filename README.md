## My process

- Wrote out mark-up and initial outline of overarching CSS.
- Got to work building.
- Googling for some bits I wasn't sure how to approach (best way to place background image on purple card).
- Finish and review.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Media queries

### What I learned

- Consolidated learning from last week in use of grid.
- How to position a background image within the container.

### Continued development

- Continue to consolidate learning with use of flexbox and grid.
- More box-shadow practise (can always get there with it, but always need to remind myself of which values affect x,y, blur & spread)
